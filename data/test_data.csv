mdo8i5,"thinking of transferring out of u of m currently a freshman who unfortunately did not enjoy her college experience. i spent my first semester in the dorms with a less than ideal roommate and a small amount of friends. my social experience wasn't the best and the entire time i was wishing to go back home or transfer schools. the only reason i didn't apply as a spring transfer elsewhere was because i was advised to give it another semester. unfortunately, since umich kicked freshmen out of the dorms i've spent the winter semester at home, while the majority of my peers got apartments or houses on campus. i tried joining greek life and eventually dropped virtual rush bc it was impossible to be in a sorority from home and i don't really have any options for fall housing besides my first semester roommate and the last thing i want to do is live in the dorms or by myself. i applied to other schools, but i honestly don't know what to do about coming back in the fall since i'm not sure if i should let go of michigan so soon or if all of this has been a sign to transfer. pls help!"

md8413,"""We’ll open Michigan Stadium to graduates during Commencement"" Link to website: [https://commencement.umich.edu/](https://commencement.umich.edu/)

Email from Schlissel: 

"" Dear Graduating Students:

We want to share the news that we will open Michigan Stadium to graduates during our May 1 virtual commencement ceremony. 

We’re  adding this opportunity to help those graduates who want to celebrate  their accomplishments together following two important changes: The  state of Michigan has increased the allowed capacity of outdoor  stadiums, and we are seeing far fewer COVID-19 cases among students.

The plans we’ve announced previously for commencement have not changed. The ceremony  itself will be virtual with synchronous content viewable by everyone,  so all graduating students wherever they choose to be and their friends  and loved ones can see the ceremony at the same time. It will also be  archived for future online viewing. The  Rackham Graduate Exercises and the different types of graduation  ceremonies held by organizations, student groups and our Ann Arbor  schools and colleges will remain virtual, as well.

And the Michigan Stadium photo opportunity will proceed as planned. 

To  help us do this safely, we’re limiting Michigan Stadium access on May 1  to Winter 2020 and Spring 2021 graduates, requiring full ResponsiBLUE  compliance, and will stagger entry to the stadium. Everyone will have a  ticket to a specific seat. For the full list of safety protocols, along  with what you can expect while in the stadium, please visit our [commencement website](https://commencement.umich.edu/).  

All  graduates who missed out on an in-person ceremony due to COVID-19 are  invited to attend and participate in any other future  main commencement of their choosing. This invitation stands regardless  of whether you opt to view commencement in the stadium May 1. 

Graduation  is such a special time for all of us at U-M, and we want to make this  milestone in your lives as memorable as possible. We’re grateful that  changes in public health guidelines and conditions now allow us to  provide the experience of being in Michigan Stadium along with  classmates when your hard-earned degrees are conferred. 

We  very much appreciate your continued diligence to the health and safety  of our community and look forward to your continuing partnership to make  this opportunity successful on May 1. 

Sincerely,

Mark S. Schlissel  
 President

I got my financial aid package from UMich today, but to my dismay the expected cost of attendance is much more than what I can afford. I understand that as an OOS I should be paying more, but the  cost per *semester* at UMich is more than twice my cost per *year* at my current school.   


What should I do? Should I contact the financial aid office and ask for more aid? (through phone or email)? Are there any other options I can explore (excluding loans)? I basically need advice - I really do want to go to umich but financial aid is not looking it ://"

Currently, I'm on the hunt for some academic opportunities, and need to see what I'm going to be doing so that I can start looking for housing for the 21-22 year. Keep in mind: I am currently in one social org (asian american association, will join VSA this or next year), I have a very, very limited resume (no work experience at all), and I'd like to travel to Florida some time in the summer.

1. Does anyone know of any academic-related summer opportunities open to engineering freshmen? I'd prefer if the opportunity is online. Are there any open clubs, projects, research, etc? It seems like co-ops, internships, and research are for sophomore/junior year and are typically in-person. If upper-classmen can speak on their experiences in past or current clubs they're in, that'd be great!
2. What are the best engineering clubs right now? Any specific electrical engineering clubs that are good? I have done some research and am not interested in ArborHacks or some hacking club.

The big projects like MASA, MRover, etc. look interesting but when should I join one of them?

Also, before anyone says anything, no, I'm not stringing him along. He's been pretty abusive physically and verbally. His most recent endeavor involved him screaming at me, blocking my way to my anxiety meds, and punching the door before slamming it. I left for a walk and came back to a literal hole punched in yet another door. Also, he sorta moved into my apartment without telling me a semester ago and I didn't really care enough to tell him no, saved me money on rent anyway. Well, I'm irresponsible with money and no longer have what I need saved up to afford the place on my own 😬. So rn I'm pretty financially dependent on staying with him, but I feel it'd probably be better for me in other areas of my life to leave.

Part of me believes that no one else will ever want me--damaged goods from a poor family and all that. And another part of me thinks this university is too big to ever even be able to find someone. Then there's the whole complicated mess of love, abuse, trauma, guilt, finances, and the pandemic. I feel isolated enough as it is without going through a break up. I guess I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons. Stay and fix it/him or leave and deal with the consequences"

mc9eid,"Is it always this bad? I transferred to UM last fall- and I will go ahead and say that this was a very poor decision on my behalf. Ever since I have arrived here, I’ve been disappointed over and over with the quality of what I’m receiving- and I can’t help but wonder if it’s just me or if this school really is this awful. 

For background- I went to UM- Flint last year for my freshman year. Classes weren’t too big, professors generally knew you by name, but the classes were pretty manageable. I worked a full time job while attending in-person classes full time as well. It was difficult at times, but man did i take it for granted. 

Now, ever since coming to Ann Arbor, I can’t even think about my college experience without breaking down and crying. I took Orgo I during my first semester at UM- Ann Arbor per the suggestion of my advisor. Absolutely awful. One exam was so unfair the professors received hate Mail over it!! The average on every exam was like a 60%! Do you know how defeating it is to study on end for 20 hours PLUS for an exam and only receive a 60 percent?! Either these professors don’t teach what they’re testing over or they’re purposefully torturing their students for trying. Either way this was the first sign that I had made a mistake by coming to Ann Arbor.

Fast forward to this semester, I have survived orgo I and surprisingly got a B in the class! (This would be impressive if a B wasn’t a 67%...) However, now I am confronted with the hate crime of a class called “math 115.” For context, I took AP Calc AB in high school, got an A in the class, and a 4 on the national exam (not too bad right? Wrong.) Since I did not get a 5, but merely a 4...,,, this credit does not transfer to this “god-tier” school. Awesome. 
This class is worse than I ever expected. Our only lectures are literal 4-5 minute YouTube videos and during the class sessions the GSI presents no new information.
I’m sorry-
Who learns calculus from subpar VIDEOS and nothing more? 
But it gets better!

After 4 weeks in the class, our professor finally sends an email introducing herself (I didn’t even know she existed until this point)-  I thought I did not have an actual professor as I had only the contact information and name of my GSI.

I was spending so much time watching the stupid videos, reading the book, looking online, and even facetiming my old AP Calc teacher- all of this wasn’t enough for me to learn the material by myself and the format of the class just was not working. After having a mental breakdown during a quiz, I finally decided to reach out to this professor expressing my concerns for the course as I believed the course was not providing adequate enough resources in order to succeed. This class had been causing me mental breakdowns nearly daily at this point so a minor complaint was well warranted. I was hoping she would work with me so that I was not suffering just to pass a class I had essentially already taken. 

The email that I sent was extremely emotional and begged for any kind of help she could offer or suggest. It has been over a month since I sent this original email and she has decided to not respond. I sent her another email in response to my prior email, calling her out for not even responding- she has decided to ignore that one as well. Is it really too much to ask for a response from a professor who literally does none of the work for the course already? It’s blatantly disrespectful to ignore the email that I had sent as it was clearly emotional and a desperate plea for any help at all that she could suggest. No response. 

Overall my experience here has been so traumatic I probably won’t be attending school in the fall. I’ve been pushed too far and expected to put my grades above my well being it feels like. Every time I contact someone to try and help the situation, they clearly do not care and don’t seem to acknowledge what I am actually saying. There is a problem at this school- much bigger than one student. The professors are pushing their students too far and not providing adequate resources. They keep claiming that they are there for their students but I have yet to hear that the students would say they have see any proof of this at all. It’s just so sad. This was my dream school and it’s ruined me. 

Does anyone else feel like this? Is this normal here? Is it only because the classes are online? Or is it always this bad?"

I have honestly **never** been in a situation where I felt a course was so poorly run- or that students were being so disrespected- that it warranted an actual complaint... Until this semester. I'm talking about EECS 496.

I'd like to think I have the discretion to be able to know when a class only *seems* bad to students due to extenuating circumstances, versus when a class is genuinely being mishandled. I and many other currently enrolled students would probably agree that this case is the latter, and I sincerely do not say that lightly.

I know sending in a complaint likely won't do a thing, but I feel like I'd be doing an injustice to the circumstances if all the needless chaos in the class went completely unrecognized on a formal level.

I understand that there is no such thing as a “guaranteed program” like in other schools, but what do they mean by “conditional assurance?” Essentially I am asking if getting into this program means getting a “higher chance” of being accepted to the School of Pharmacy, if I am guaranteed a spot given I complete the prerequisite courses/keep my GPA up, or if it gives me no advantage over any other applicant.

I graduated from UC Berkeley and from what some peers who went to UMich have told me, the Ann Arbor vibe is similar to Berkeley's. I loved my undergrad experience, and I'm thinking whether I'd want to be in similar environment.

Anyone who's been to both cities or attended the schools -- I would appreciate your input! Thank you."
macsop,"Anyone just not know how you're doing in classes? I have 2 stem classes in LSA and averages on nearly every single assignment but homework has had a failing average. Almost every in-class quiz has an average of like 4 or 5 out of 10, one midterm had an average of 58% (when it's normally like >75%). The standard deviation on said midterm was a 20 (with 100+ students). I guess you can curve that, but that doesn't feel like a fair assessment if the distribution is that skewed. 

I just have literally no idea how I'm doing because everyone is failing together. When a professor was asked in class ""how can we do better on quizzes"" he deadass just said ""I don't know"" because he didn't make the quizzes and doesn't really teach to them. 

I know everyone's having a bad time in covid but just wanted to know if other students' classes were going about like this? I know I'm only a freshman, but it felt like last sem and summer I could really easily gauge how well I was doing in classes and know my grade accurately.

It is a nice time to go outside for a jog in shirts and shorts, playing intramural sports(via following COVID guidelines), and seeing the squirrels roam around campus. The crisp, fresh air has encouraged me to take a break from Zoom University and look at nature’s wonder. If I was in A2, I would jog with content to see the Clock Tower, the Big House, the Dude, and of course the iconic Cube I see all the time on social media. This weather brings euphoric feelings to me as I wish that I can spin the Cube as fast as I can. In short, enjoy the outdoor activities with caution in Ann Arbor before the Michigan weather could decide to snow again."
ma1l3v,"UCB Meng in ME(aerospace concentration) VS.Cornell MS ME VS. Imperial MS aerospace engr VS. UMich MS aerospace engr Hello everyone i just got admitted to some grad schools and i can't  decide which one to go... I have UCB Meng in ME(aerospace  concentration), Cornell MS ME, Imperial College MS aerospace engr, UMich  MS aerospace engr, and Columbia MS ME... These 5 are my final round  choices.

Since i study aerospace engr in my undergrad at Purdue, i don't want  to switch to ME if possible. So speaking of aerospace engineering first,  it looks like UCB is a better choice comparing to Umich and Imperial.  However, UCB only offers a Meng program and no MS this year(sad). I  wonder if it is still obviously better than the other MS programs. And  Imperial's MS is also 1 year. I heard people saying something bad about  it.. Umich i think is similar but overall better than Purdue, which has been one of my dream school. Its aerospace is def top5 in US.

Also, Cornell and Columbia are Ivy schools and are strong at ME(which  i don't know much at least for now...i just talked to some students in  these two). But they don't offer aerospace stuff and i find that a lot  of people get admitted which makes it looks a little...

Would I still get the same opportunities as someone in the MS Robotics course in terms of clubs, facilities, etc.

The problem I found is on the website for area wise courses for ECE the robotics section had very few major courses (M and E) for the Robotics (RO) section. Is that what I have to choose from or is there a bigger list of options for it. Also how easy/difficult is it to switch the focus area after joining?

m8s86o,"Questions about Campus Culture Hello all! I’m very happy to say I was recently accepted as an LSA Transfer Student for Fall 2021. I have a couple questions that I was hoping current students could fill me in on before I start thinking about enrolling.

A bit of my background to start: I’m a non-trad, first gen student. I’m 24 and currently active duty military and will basically be getting out in the summer and then moving right in on to school. I’m really motivated to do well in school because I see it not just as an opportunity for me, but for my family. Neither of my parents went to a four-year uni (community college and trade school).

And so a big thing for me is fitting into campus and campus culture. I’m older and not super into partying like crazy anymore (trust me, I’ve done plenty of that in the military), and I want to be academically challenged. 

What’s campus culture like for someone who is super passionate about learning and school? I’ve tried informing myself through prospective student stuff and reading the UofM website, but I find it hard and overwhelming a little to navigate what I should be looking out for and I figure it’s better to ask people who are literally living it. Also, how do older students fit into the student body?

That’s all that immediately comes to mind. Thanks all for reading."

But actually, what was her goal in sending this email? I really don't get it. Actually, the second paragraph seems to accurately summarize exactly what this email is. I am Asian and this email accomplishes nothing but soothing this professor's white guilt while also distracting her from actually answering student questions for the 4 assignments due tonight.

CLARIFICATION:  I am more annoyed that my prof. decided to spend an hour this morning typing this out as opposed to answering my question which I emailed last night.

## What were you doing before Flexport?

I was working in Venture Capital (at a firm called Signia Venture Partners) in the Bay Area. I was an associate sourcing deals and doing interesting research. Coincidentally, between investing in Flexport and another YC company, Signia went with the other company.

That other company was called Cruise, which got like a $2B exit in two and a half years, so that worked out well for them.

Before the startup world, I was on Wall Street doing Investment Banking.

## So post college, were you always planning to do Finance? And was doing your own thing or working at a startup always at the back of your mind?

So back then, startups weren’t as big a thing as they are now. I saw Finance as the fastest way to pay off my student loans. I’m from an immigrant family, so I paid for most of my education myself. And investment banking let me pay off everything very quickly, within the first 2-3 years.

As a result, though, I was nearly broke when I moved to Silicon Valley! So all that Wall Street money and bonus just went off to paying my student loans.

## That’s interesting, because I read somewhere that even Ryan (CEO of Flexport) graduated from his MBA program with like 140k in debt and used his previous business, ImportGenius, to pay that debt off. So, you’re working at this VC firm - what makes you want to join Flexport?

My background was in Computer Science and Business, so I was always interested in technology. In undergrad, I also spent a lot of time starting and running organisations - starting teams, growing teams, scaling teams etc. And my parents also ran small businesses growing up, so I did a lot of that as a kid.

International trade, freight forwarding, customs brokerage etc - it was all new to me, but because my dad used to receive cargo and stuff for his grocery store, it wasn’t completely left field.

The reason I joined after doing my due diligence was that a lot of the “goldilocks” ingredients were there. Ryan was a founder with two successful exits in adjacent industries. I had also done some research on unicorn startups and one of the commonalities was that most of the founders are in their early / mid thirties, have had a prior exit in a similar space, and are working on an enterprise company.

So Ryan checked a lot of those buckets. The freight forwarding industry itself was fairly stagnant and ripe for disruption. We were one of the first logistics technology companies to emerge and get funding, so we did something right and helped open the floodgates for plenty of other companies.

Finally, Ryan is a true entrepreneur and someone I wanted to learn from.

## Did you see joining the company as risky?

When your bank account is small, you have nothing to lose. The only risky thing was not doing anything. I think that the challenge here is that when you leave something that is kind of a prefixed journey (step 1, step 2, etc), a lot of your friends and colleagues are going to really question what you’re doing.

Your colleagues will see it as a ridiculous risk and wonder why you’re joining a no name company. But hopefully you’ll also have some good friends who are supportive of what you’re doing.

I think that when you do a startup or join one at an early stage, you definitely take on risk but you have to trust that no matter what you have to learn or do something. The rest is all upside.

## What did you join as? Was Ryan even looking to hire someone at the time?

The actual job post that Ryan had was for a jack of all trades. Given my background in engineering, business, and a little bit of design, it seemed to resonate and work well. Mix that in with family entrepreneurial hustle, that also was well received.

And for folks who are looking to join an early stage startup, you have to have no ego and be willing to do anything and everything. My hats consisted of many things. I did ops, sales, finance, design and product.

https://preview.redd.it/sl3prrivoln61.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa2958e4bebd96aa8074feb265c142c557b2dd9

## Were you getting on the phone with customers at this stage too?

Everyday. So from 9am until 5pm, we’d have a call every 10 or so minutes. Which means that the entire day we’d basically just be processing these customer requests, feedbacks, orders etc. And then we’d actually start the “real work” from 5pm to 10pm, or until later.

The first year was very aggressive. I lived in Palo Alto at the time so I would be on the CalTrain by 7am, in the office in downtown SF by like 8:30, and then we’d work until 5 or 6, have dinner, and then work until around 10 again.

Then, I’d take the CalTrain back to Palo Alto anywhere between 9pm to 11pm, get home, and work from 12 to 2 again. It was crazy because I had to work two shifts since we had both US clients and Asian partners. So when night came, Asia would wake up, and I’d need to be on the phone with our partners, factories, etc over there.

## In another interview you mentioned that when you were talking to your customers, you realized their needs were more than just customs clearance. They wanted you guys to manage their whole supply chain. When did that realization occur and is that when you truly realized the scale of the opportunity?

The big picture scale was always apparent. Our trojan horse was customs, and that was the core business for a period of time. We never thought that the business would explode so quickly in terms of scope in the way that it did - that was serendipitous. A lot of it was just down to the fact that success compounds and we had tons of momentum behind us.

To answer your question more directly - since we were on the phone all day with our customers, we got to know their pain points really well. What were they scared of? What sucked for them? These were questions that were really easy for us to answer.

More generally, most people don’t like to be uncomfortable. People don’t like pain. But you need it. If you actually want to find out what problem needs solving, you need to feel the pain. If you don’t feel the pain, you’re not going to build the right thing and you’re not going to be able to fix it.

You’re going to be working from an ivory tower and being all theoretical. So the feedback that we got over the first 3-4 months was overwhelming: our customers felt like their freight partners were often mismanaged their shipments, communicated poorly, coordinated poorly, and lacked accountability. No managed service... We wanted to step up and help.

## What did these early customers look like? Were you already landing enterprise customers or were these mom&pop shops?

I think the majority of the early stage clients were mom and pop shops. Majority of them were just companies that were googling customs clearance and trying to look for someone to save their ass. And so usually, that didn’t make for the easiest of customer problems, but it definitely showed us what was painful.

To be honest, when we were more deliberate about the types of customers that we wanted to work with, we wanted to find people that were philosophically aligned with us. I think that’s true for any partnership you should do as a business. And when we started doing that, we started to find customers who were growing much faster and wanted to work with us. So as you can imagine, a lot of startups and bay area companies resonated with our vision: ""to make global trade easy for everyone"".

## In one of your blog posts, you describe the distinction between working on the business vs in the business. Did you enjoy the evolution of your role into one that focused on building systems and ensuring everything ran smoothly? I know a lot of people that prefer just doing the stuff that takes a company from 0-1.

Yeah, many of those rapid changes were a lot of fun and got to really test your mettle. I think the first few years it was a lot about turning the individual into institutional, reflecting about what was working and what wasn’t.

So, very systematically, every 2 weeks we had workshops that I led to figure out where the holes were in our process. We were very intentional about this - we didn’t wait for an account exec or an ops teammate to slowly bubble problems up. We were still small, still lean, and our DNA said we want to solve problems.

Everyone on the team felt like they were a true product owner and they were solving problems for the business that went beyond just their job title. Everybody was contributing to how we could improve the process and product.

## And I think another cool thing here is that I’ve read you guys insist on hiring generalists rather than experts. I’m sure that helped with building an org that is improving based on first principles and constantly rethinking the way processes are handled?

Yeah, it was very deliberate. We wanted to have a good mix between experienced industry knowledge, experienced tech knowledge, and then the generalist problem solvers. By combining these 3 types of personas together, you created a very strong culture and also a dynamic that allows your team to ask questions like “Hey, why isn’t this tech possible?” or “Hey, why didn’t the incumbents do something like this before?”.

And that was very powerful. It made our feedback loop remarkably fast and agile.

## How do you scale culture? I know one of your big values is radical candor. And I’m wondering with so many offices now and a much larger number of employees, how do you ensure that these principles you’ve laid out are actually acted upon globally?

That is an ever changing problem with an ever changing solution. So I don’t have a perfect answer for you. What I can say, it’s probably one of the biggest topics that every company will always need to keep on top of mind.

Values stem from people. Things like hiring, managing, and coaching. All those elements are important and you need to be intentional about how you do each of those things. For example, are you looking for people that demonstrate these attributes we’ve communicated? Also, are you instilling the right positive feedback loop when they’re being trained? Do they see that in practice? And then, do you lead or have managers that embody this as well?

In regards to scaling this, it’s hard. But in my opinion it just needs a real human touch. You are able to scale culture by having strong culture carriers and ultimately that means you need to have strong managers. I think having strong individual culture carriers is great, but if you have a manager that is a strong culture carrier, and they’re able to recruit, manage, and lead, then that’s a huge multiplier and you have a 1 to N dynamic.

## What advice do you have for others looking to join a very early stage venture?

Make it so that your decision is a win-win no matter what happens. And if you feel like your decision is going to be a win-win no matter what happens, then go for it. Because you’re going to be jittery about joining a new company, you’re going to weigh the pros and cons, think about what the opportunity costs is, etc - and all of that is true.

But what I mean by ""make it win-win"", is that you're able to make the best of the situation regardless of whether the company crushes it or has to fold. If the company does well, then great, you're in a win scenario. But what if, for some reason it fails? Do you still feel like you'd be able to pick up new skills? Learn from your leaders and colleagues? Push your comfort zone? And become more tempered? If so, then you've found a win-win scenario.

## What are you focused on now?

I’m a light-weight angel investor, but I love working with founders and helping them navigate that seed to late Series A / early B stage. I enjoy helping them figure out how to hire, grow, and build. And ultimately, set up the infrastructure needed to get scaling ready and in place. By no means am I an expert in all these things, but I think for the Seed to Series B stage, my insights are helpful for a lot of entrepreneurs. I love working on those challenges.

This applies to  undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in a degree-seeking program  on the Ann Arbor campus. 

College credit earned through tests taken before  matriculation, such as Advanced Placement and International  Baccalaureate exams, and tests such as ACT, SAT, AVL, CLEP, and IMAT,  will not be counted for registration priority purposes. The change  ensures that U-M students who attended high schools with few or no  opportunities to earn test credit will not be at a disadvantage in  appointment assignments.

m5ym6q,"UMich vs UIUC CS Hello! I'm currently debating between CS at UMich and UIUC in the engineering schools and was hoping for some insight from current students. While similar questions have been answered before, I do have a few specific concerns surrounding course availability and double majoring that I hoped could be addressed. So far, I've noticed a couple of differentiating factors:

* I want to either double major/minor in business or do a pre-med track and I know that both schools have different policies for how you can apply to study either one. UMich seems more flexible compared to UIUC, but the admissions committee said that UIUC lets you double major easily as well. UMich is also more well-known for most subjects outside of engineering. Ultimately, I want to pursue something in healthcare tech, so I want to go to a college that fits that goal best.
* I've heard that at UMich, it's difficult to get the classes you want in CS because the major isn't capped so many people try to sign up. Since the major is capped at UIUC, it's easier to get the CS courses you want there. I do have AP credits though (5 in APCS, 4 in Calc BC, 5s in Economics, 5s in Bio and Chem, 4's in US and World History) so I'm hoping that makes the process easier.
* Luckily for me, the cost isn't an issue, but I would prefer the cheaper option (UIUC) if the academic opportunities at both schools are the same/similar enough.

Do you have any input on these considerations and which college I should choose?"

I'm considering doing a dual degree in CS and Art&Design so I'm wondering if anyone has done this combination. If so, how were you able to manage? I know that dual degrees are ridiculously hard to balance (literally kiss of death if you factor in CS) but I think this combination would help me achieve my goals post-graduation. I'm heavily considering a fifth year to make this choice (as well as a healthy college experience) feasible. I'll be coming in with AP credits and am willing to plan my courses for my college years so everything would go as smoothly as possible. I considered a minor for either one (most reasonably Art&Design as it won't guarentee stability) but I realized that I don't want art to take second priority. For some background, I almost decided on art school but change my mind last minute as well as spent most of my hs career committed to art if that can attest to my seriousness about a dual degree I guess."

There are a lot of things (like sensory things) that put me where X happened. There are also other side effects. I feel really bad about talking about it because this was all long ago. I have talked about this with 2 people I have been comfortable with and a couple times through anonymity. The past couple years have been rough. I have some nice and not so nice coping mechanisms. (thank god for soundproof headphones and big stuffed animal). Things that take me back are fairly common things so it's hard (especially when I was living with my family that I was either uncomfortable talking with things about or did not want to hurt their feelings). When I get taken back it takes me about an hour or two to recover fully (I can sort of recover instantly but I risk falling back again). This makes exams very hard as they are timed. Either I have the perfect setup (pay the roommate to be quiet, double check everything) or it consumes me. So far, everything has been okay. Also I wish I could sleep at night lol. Please don't downvote me into oblivion for complaining that would make me have a panic attack haha. I am very scared for when circumstances are not perfect and I fail. For those who will say get over it, you will have these sensory stimulations otherwise, I know I know I am trying I am trying this is really hard I don't like this and everything sucks. I was wondering if I could get extra time on exams and could bring a stuffed animal and headphones like I get to on online exams so I can blockout the other people from taking me back, but like I need a real condition like a disability so I don't know if I can. I have tried fixing this by forcing  myself to experience everything but that just makes me associate more stuff and have more things that take me back so I don't do that. So I signed up for an initial consultation with CAPS and I have that a couple weeks from now. What should I not say to not get put in the luney bin. I am very nervous to talk about it because my parents said if I ever went to a person to talk about it that they would put me in a luney bin (my parents saw the side effects so they know I am crazy). I am not suicidal. I am enjoying this big stuffed animal, it brings me great joy. i dont know man I know know

m58pgt,"Alumni: Seeking 1-2 people to interview for capstone project due tomorrow morning Do you have life experiences? *Of course you do!* Please tell me about them; I have 13 hours to complete this project for my capstone class.

HI UofM! I am a graduating senior and I have a capstone midterm project due at 9am EST. *I'm overwhelmed and I would love to interview you!*

The project is called ""Crowdsourcing a Launch Plan"" and I have been too busy to start it until two hours ago. This interview consists of \*adulting\* questions like:

1. What makes getting up in the morning worth it for you?
2. What have you learned throughout your career?
3. What advice would you give to a chronically stressed out college graduate like me?

*and so much more! Tell me about your failures, your dreams, and your achievements-- It's kind of like therapy, but advice!*

And if that wasn't enough to excite you to help out with this project, you get to help me! yes me! not fail this capstone project. Here are the pertinent details, taking interviews whenever someone feels bad for me and gives me one:

1. Requesting alumni of any age, preferably those with work experience
2. If you cannot help, I will also gladly take husbands, wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, parents, siblings, etc. with careers, dreams, and actual responsibilities outside of work, should you volunteer them or they also feel bad for me. Pets are also accepted to be told that they are good boys and girls.
3. Interviews are for one hour, maximum.
4. 1-2 participants required (I have successfully roped in mom and dad, but have no available friends because of P A N D E M I C)
5. Your information will be kept confidential and non-identifying.
6. Interviews may be conducted via phone, FB calls, Zoom, Bluejeans, etc. Cameras are encouraged to be off-- the Zoom fatigue is real. Pets are the exception.
7. You must believe the earth is round. This is nonnegotiable.

Warning: This interview will require you to talk about failing. If that is too traumatizing due to the \*current circumstances\* (ie the world falling apart), let this serve as a warning.

Thank you all in advance! I appreciate your consideration, but even more so, your interview. I'll be up all night to take these :("

 I feel like I'm losing control this semester, going back and forth between insomnia and sleeping 12+ hours a day.

I lived in a dorm where we would get multiple COVID cases a day and was honestly super scared of catching it because my dad is immunocompromised. I think because of this I kinda stayed in my room all the time. Although I have a friend group, I feel like I didn't get to rlly know them cause I was scared of catching COVID (a few of them ended up catching it) and didn't hang out a lot. Now for housing next semester, I feel like I kinda screwed up because I don't rlly know who to dorm with (my roommate wanted to room with their friend group) and I feel out of place socially. A lot of the off-campus housing websites have around 10 ppl of my gender and age, so idk where to find roommates as a sophomore next semester. Any advice on what to do?

m4gld7,"I just took a ""W,"" any advice/input on potential consequences for internships So I am currently a 1st-year student in engineering, I came from a high school where I did not get prepared well for math and physics. This semester however I am taking Phys 140/141, math 116, and ENGR 101. I recently dropped Econ 101 so I could focus more on math and physics and build my knowledge in the areas so when I take future classes I feel more comfortable. My current GPA is 3.39, and I'm guessing it would be around the same at the end of this semester. I'm worried however that because I dropped econ 101, and have a ""W"" on my unofficial transcript it will look bad for when I apply for internships. I mainly want to apply next year or the start of my junior year for some defense companies, such as BAE Systems, General Dynamics, or Raytheon. How will this affect me? Has any engineering student been asked about a ""W"" on their unofficial transcript when applying to such/type of companies? ( ik bc of covid it won't appear on my official transcript, but most of these companies have you upload your transcript and usually ask for an official if they're interested). I plan to take summer classes, about 6 credits, so I can retake econ 101 in the summer since it's a required elective for mechanical engineering, also side question(should I take these classes at a cc or at umich, does that have any effect on how '""credible"" it is, I'm considering the cc option because its cheaper and it transfers, but bc I dropped econ at umich I'm not sure on what to do."

UMich would require pretty hefty loans, and it's definitely the most ""prestigious"" school on this list, but do you think it's worth the hefty price tag for pre med?

m446vz,"I spent 6.5 years as an undergrad In high school, I had an effortless 4.0 GPA taking advanced classes. I didn't have to study and I did about 10 hours of homework at home during my entire time in high school because I could just do everything else at school. I thought this whole school thing was easy, I'm a damn genius. My whole family were Michigan fans, but I was the first to actually attend, and I thought it was going to continue to be easy.

&#x200B;

It was not easy. In fact, classes at Michigan were brutal, every one of them. I learned how to properly study and do homework, but not fast enough. I kept failing classes to the point I was at least a year behind. I kept trying to get better, but it wasn't working, I kept barely passing or outright failing classes. By the time that I should have been graduating, I was actually on academic probation. I took a semester off of school because I was kicked out, not because I wanted to. I came back and I was pushing 25 years old and racking up a ridiculous amount of debt. I finally learned how to study and passed the remaining classes I needed to get my bachelor's, it was practically a miracle.

&#x200B;

I'm basically a case study on how not to do things. Follow my path if you want to be buried in debt and filled with doubt.

&#x200B;

Well, now I have all of my private loans paid off and I am buying my own place. A failure like me has achieved this much, just imagine what a successful person could have do."

Please don't tell me it's what I make of it. I'm doing all I can to make friends while dealing with my mental health situation while dealing with my school work.  I'm scared that the people who refuse or are scared to get vaccinated are going to be the reason things stay in this shitty place. Even then, even then I feel so fucking depressed. It's not about Covid. My life just fucked me up that much. All I want is for life to not be so depressing I'm going to die at this rate.

3. Do you feel like you know enough and care enough about both subjects?
4. Why the two you picked? 
5. Would you recommend that?"
m3kpmo,"Please know that we need to evolve as a community , moving forward. Let's talk about it and come up with a plan. We don't know what the Fall plan will be, it's an exciting, but scary morning today. Most likely though, we are going to be moving towards what we know as normal. However, we can't act like this never happened. We have to evolve with this event, stitched into our school's history.  Just like we evolve as individuals when significant things happen in our lives.

So let's figure out how we can do that. I will list some things we must keep in mind, and things we should do moving forward, and you can name your own too.

&#x200B;

We must remember that when push came to shove, time after time, our school chose profit, over our safety. We must continue to counter any self congratualatory schpeel they put out, with acknowledgement of the good, but also the unarguable bad.

We must remember that the events this world event caused, have altered the mental well being for many wolverines to a greater degree. Some lost loved ones, jobs, developed depression out of isolation, etc. We must continue the culture  heightened mental health awareness for them, and the people who still experience bad mental health conditions they had before, and might carry after, this pandemic.

&#x200B;

Right now, we shouldn't force vaccines, but we should be engaging our with our community and talking to those with reservations of the vaccine. Seeing if we can talk them through their fears, support them, so we can have as much herd immunity as possible. We won't convince everyone, but civil, safe engagement will be key. Also yes, some can't due to their immune systems, I'm aware.

&#x200B;

We must continue and strengthen the culture of looking after, respecting, thanking, and helping make the jobs easier of staff like MDining, RAs, , custodians, IT, bus drivers, all the amazing staff who make this school run.  , what I dub the ""Thank the Bus Driver"" culture (I was stuck babysitting my Fortnite loving nephews too long send help) 

We should recognize the professors and GSIs and TAs and tutoring / CSP / math lab peeps who were GOATS and rose to the challenge of the pandemic, despite inperfections. We should also recognize some professors and GSIs didn't, that's a damn shame, but it should all be noted. People show their character in the toughest of times.

&#x200B;

On that note, we should look out for each other, we should stay home if we are sick, or if we absolutely have to go to school, wear a mask. I didn't get sick this winter , thanks to the good mask wearing. We should continue to improve our habits so that we don't overcrowd Bdubs during lockdown during a pandemic COME ONNN

Finally but very important, we do need to look after our environment more. We need to try and eat less meat and encourage the same of others. This is something I need to work on too, We need to practice in behavior to help our environment, plant trees, reserve our power sources, fall in love with sustainable cooking. This allows us to not only prolong the life of our planet, but prevent this last year from happening again as best as we can.

&#x200B;

If you have any other points you think are important, drop them down below.

&#x200B;

Thank you."

1. Is it likely to enroll in the ULCS courses you want? I know that there is a 2-ULCS-per-semester limit and usually long waiting lists.
2. How is the teaching quality of the CS classes in general? This probably varies much among classes, but I transferred from a college with small class sizes and was kinda unsure about things in a big school like umich.
3. Do you have to be super competitive to get research opportunities with the CS faculties? I assume that there are only a few spots available but a lot of people applying.

I’d really appreciate your feedback as I’d love to break the good news to my family but I want to be a 100% sure that I’m in.

m2dgam,"Umich covid policy does not seem to be logical Edit: There is no double standard. It seems u of m has developed 2 different solutions to stop the spread of covid to best suit the 2 different situations. The solution implemented in hospitals is a scientifically motivated one and is safe. The same is true for the undergrad policy, it just does it a different way.

I will leave the post here in case you want to know why I was wrong or had similar questions. Just know that all the conclusions below this line are wrong.
_____________________________________________________


I wanted to bring attention to what I thought was an interesting double standard in UofM's covid policy. I am not a doctor and the last time I took any health related science class was highschool so view my conclusion (that a double standard exists) with that in mind. But to the fullest extent of my knowledge, I do believe the statements I am making are true.

Umich undergrads are required to be tested weekly if they have in person classes or want to use university facilities. The typical demographic of a u of m undergrad is a young adult with little to no medical problems that cause additional risk for covid. Undergrads primarily interact with other undergrads who are low risk also, but some undergrads are at risk and some undergrads interact with older, more vulnerable populations. UofM's conclusions from this was that it was safest practice to test undergrads weekly to prevent the spread of covid to at risk peoples. I will contrast this with their hospital policy.

At this point most hospital workers have gotten the vaccine, but not all of them. Many hospital workers interact with patients who are immunocompromised. (Cancer patients, people recovering from surgery, etc.) It was recently made know to me that hospital workers(My source worked at Mott's) are not required to be tested even if they have not been vaccinated, and are not required to be tested unless they show symptoms. They fill out the responsiblue screening daily like students did first semester still, but no weekly covid test is required.

This is the conclusions part that you should consider for yourself. My word is not any form of authority and should not be taken as one.

It seems that the danger of a hospital workers getting covid and potentially spreading it to not only temporarily immunocompromised patients who do not have the vaccine or other employees who do not have the vaccine is much greater than risk of undergrad students passing the virus to at risk people, who they come into contact with much less frequently than hospital workers. There could be some sort of herd immunity at the hospital that I am unaware of, or some other factor I have never heard of that makes hospitals very unlikely to spread the virus, but I have not heard anything like that yet (Not meaning that it isn't there, but that I don't know if it is). Assuming that the hospital environment is comparable to other environments, it seems that either excessive precautions are being taken for undergrad students or that insufficient precautions are being taken in hospitals.

If you are educated about this feel free to leave a comment clarifying this for me and all the people like me who are in the dark. I will edit the post as necessary to correct any accidental misinformation."

I can figure out the majority of multiple choice questions quite easily but the written practice has been killing me. Even the “easier” questions that aren’t exam questions but general practice have been rough. It seems like I can’t solve any of them and that I have no ability to get better at doing them. Can I please get some tips on how to get better at the written problems and coming up with the algorithm I need? I want to just keep trying but I am not improving with practice.

lyra60,"Failing 281 Hi guys I am a freshman at umich intending to study CS. However, I am facing a tremendous obstacle of passing eecs 281. I think I am understanding the concepts relatively fine; however, I am very not used to developing such heavy projects all by myself and thus am failing the project portion of the class. I really tried to start early but my mind simply wasn't there and could not focus. If I were to take this class again I wouldn't know what could've changed so I can do better as I really tired. I think I may need 90% averages across the next two projects to meet the minimum competency for passing the class. I am totally freaked out and not sure what to do. I always enjoyed technology and computers, but doing these projects are simply not my thing. I like projects that are more visual such as stuff on [code.org](https://code.org) where I build a game or simulation that I can see; not some fake simulation with mere input files and through terminal command. 

&#x200B;

I am debating to either drop this class rn or drop at the very end of the course before the last day of class so I will not get a W on my official transcript nor NRC. I really like coding, but this class is making me debate whether I am able to continue study CS at Michigan, as well as my ability as a programmer and a student.

How practical is it to live in Detroit and drive to campus? Seems like you can get a much better bang for your buck housing-wise.

Still want to be close to walkable neighborhood amenities like restaurants, bars, grocery, etc. Considering Midtown/ Medical Center area. If you have experience parking in the UMich lots, that would be helpful too. I don't mind the longer commute and paying the yearly fee for the garages as long as finding a spot is not impossible. Also, how far in advanced do you need to look at apartments? Thoughts?

lxory3,"Social anxiety Hello

I’ve been struggling with social anxiety for a few years now, but it’s never been something I couldn’t handle. Since covid began, I’ve been spending most of my time along and currently live at home, not on campus. This has worsened my social anxiety incredibly. 

I find it extremely difficult to log onto my classes or club meetings each day, and I try super hard not to speak. When I do speak, my anxiety feels so strong that I have trouble putting my words together and to say something meaningful. I sound so unintelligent compared to my peers. 

When I think about returning to campus next year, I get sick. I will be living in a co-op, which I was excited for, but now I’m really really scared about the social situation there. I’m scared my social anxiety will continue to debilitate me even after I’ve returned to campus.  

I’m not going to write too much more of my symptoms because I don’t need to. I know I should get help. I’m not able to find a therapist right now as I’m living at home and simply cannot afford one.

lwwlkr,"Thoughts on EECS 281 in the spring? + dealing with imposter syndrome and self doubt I am planning on majoring in cs and I was taking EECS 281 this semester. However, my mental health has been seriously suffering these past few months and so I dropped the class a while ago. My mental health also started to affect me in end of last semester in EECS 280, to the point where on the first exam I scored in the 90s and on the final exam I was in the 70s. This made 281 immediately overwhelming because a lot of the topics at the end of 280 are used in 281. I’ve been struggling with imposter syndrome and questioning whether or not I am actually smart enough to be a cs major because in 281 I felt like I just had no idea what I was going and it made me seriously doubt myself. I dropped the class to help my mental health but instead I’m finding myself dreading the class and also beating myself up for dropping it in the first place and failing to learn the content well enough in 280. 

So now I’m trying to decide if I should take 281 in the spring semester or just wait to take it next fall. If I take it in the spring then I would be ready for fall internships, but I am also very intimidated by the shortened semester and heavier workload and I don’t know if I can do it. I have actually been having nightmares about the class it’s been stressing me out so much. 

So, does anyone have any experiences or advice about EECS 281 in the spring? Ways to prepare for 281? How to combat imposter syndrome and self doubt? Also, if I do end up taking 281 in the fall, do I still have a chance at getting an internship?"

I wish I could give advice. I wish I could tell you to just suck it up and power through for a few more months. But I can't. I haven't been there. I haven't had to stay on top of classes during a pandemic. I haven't needed to attend Zoom classes all day. I haven't had to balance online class with online homework and online papers and online office hours and online *everything*. Just typing that sounds exhausting.

But I am here to tell you: **your feelings are valid.** I cannot imagine any of this. In fact, I don't think anyone outside of your position can. What you're working through is nothing short of miraculous. Please take time to recognize this. You have every right to be stressed, weakened, emptied, unmotivated, frustrated or anything else you're feeling. 

College is supposed to be the 'best years of your life.' Maybe it already has been for you. If not, I really truly hope that y'all are able to find this out first-hand soon. Michigan is a wonderful place with many wonderful people, and though I haven't been away for too long, I find myself longing for Ann Arbor throughout every day. Take time to realize what you're going through - the good and the bad. Let me know if you ever wanna chat. Your fellow wolverines are rooting hard for y'all, I promise."

I spent too much time watching Youtube this year. So I made a chrome extension to constantly remember goals for 2021 before I type youtube.com into my browser.

This is year has been a bit bittersweet for me. Since I realized 2021 is going to be another whole year of Zoom University, everything became unproductive. I was a bit lost in my life.

My solution was regularly reminding my goals! Every morning, I read my goals out loud for 2021 and spent a few minutes checking the progress. This little practice really helped me a lot. It was a small thing but really made me stay motivated for the whole day.

As I graduate this summer, I want to finish strong and also meaningful. So my friend and I created this Chrome Extension! Yes, there are tons of extensions for new tab productivity but I wanted something simple and clean. Crazyones Tab features inspiring quotes from great entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates! Plus whenever you open a new tab, you'll be able to see new quotes as well as your goals for 2021. We designed the extension to become a source of motivation + to stay on top of your goals for 2021.

My friend and I started building this Chrome Extension as a side project and now it became the most meaningful and memorable part of my college experience. It's not perfect but I hope this helps to boost people's productivity and stop watching YouTube :)

You can find the extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crazyones-new-tab/noacokcfnplaajfaajhfcnmniehoddcd

Thanks!"
lw8mv1,"Chem 125/126/130 at community college in spring 21 I’m planning to take chem 125/126/130 this spring at some other college where the class would be easier and of lesser cost. When I looked up at WCC, I’ll have to take 2 classes worth 8 credits to fulfil the equivalency, i.e. more workload than required . Any recommendation on where I can take this class for 5 credits?"
lvxmq1,"Confused about EECS 183 detection system A friend of mine took EECs 183 last semester, and I am taking EEC's right now. After I submitted my most recent project (I did not cheat, or share anything/look up anything) I compared my code to hers. And it was very very similar. I just do not get how the plagiarism detection system that EECS department uses detects cheating. EECS 183 is a intro class with minimal solutions to the test cases. There are not many different ways to write the code from someone else. But I noticed one or more of my functions is almost exactly the same except for a different variable. But she did not show me anything when I was working on it because she knew the consequences of a Honor Code Violation. But now I am scared that I will be violated for doing nothing wrong, except writing my own code that is perhaps similar to hers. Is this just how it is for EECS 183? Are the teachers more lenient on the Honor Code Violation for the first 2 projects. The project literally tells you exactly what to do, there is not much room for creativity. Also, I tried looking up cases of EECs 183 violations and I can not find many. Is this the reason why? I can only find Honor Code violations for EECS 280 and above. Anyways, I saw that I will get -1/3 of a letter grade and a 0 on the assignment. And I heard it is a long process to fight it. What can I do?? I am definitely going to fight it if I get accused because I am innocent, but I do not feel like taking all the time to do so. This is annoying. If whatever, detection system they use actually flags my code, then it must flag 100 others because that makes no sense. Literally....literally for some functions there is a simple way to do it, then there is a complex way. And I am sure many people choose the simple way. And for a intro course like this, there has to be a huge overlap in similar code. Right? I am sorry for ranting, you can downvote this, but I am just upset, because I just compared my code with hers and saw all the similarities. And I am currently am having a freakout and can't go to bed. Also, if my parents ever found out that I got a violation for cheating. I would actually not be alive. Please answer with anything- it can be EECS 183 violations you heard of, or how strict the EECS 183 instructors are on similarity for the first two projects, or anything!!! Thank you guys so much. ps. I need to go to bed now, I have been freaking out about this violation stuff for 4 hours now."
lw6tgp,"I just can't focus anymore This is less of a rant and more of just an observation, I guess. 

I'm sure nearly everyone feels the same way, but just when I think I've burned out, there's just more and more burnout that follows. All my classes are synchronous and it's gotten to a point where my first thought every morning when I wake up is ""I hate X class so much."" I can tell that most people probably feel burned out, as class averages on quizzes in many of my classes are solidly in the 50%'s (as are mine lmao).  I've been able to focus for the past 1.5 sems on zoom (including Spring), but recently it's just gotten to the point where no matter how hard I try, I cannot bring myself to pay attention in some classes. Has anyone encountered this and successfully combatted it? I'd appreciate any tips at all"
lw67ex,DTW Does anyone know of any public transportation services that are currently operating to DTW?
lw5y84,Places to Compost Does anyone know of any places to compost on campus? I used to use the dorms but they're closed now. Or places in Ann Arbor that collect compost off campus!

lw0wtq,What Programming Language does the EECS Department Prefer? Incoming freshman in the fall and I want to be comfortable with the language. I know Java and Swift but haven't grown comfortable with Python or C. Thanks.
lvw42m,"question !! so i have not been accepted yet but i got an email saying i should apply for financial aid with the email title “entering students and families” , does that mean i got in or am i looking to much into it. i just really want to go to this school so it makes sense if i’m looking to much into it lol."

I had to an emergency/urgent crisis meeting with a CAPS rep. I\\'m not sure what their idea is of care. I spoke to someone who clearly was reading off a transcript, I assume some grad student practicing. Essentially, I was told to talk about what\\'s going on (took like 35-45 minutes) then for the last 15ish minutes I was given basic coping mechanisms that I could have found by googling 'how to stop being depressed/anxious). I\\'m not sure if this is normal or what. I definitely don\\'t blame the dude I spoke to because I assume he was just trying to do his job. Its probably a good thing I spoke to this guy because I wasn\\'t suicidal. If someone who wanted to die accidentally got paired with a robotic apathetic grad student during a serious crisis it could end awfully. I think I felt a little better after talking to the guy simply because it was so comical that a student crisis hotline was being manned by other students at this school who have lost interest in their work. I wish they would fund CAPS more, especially during this pandemic, so that these apathetic grad students can take care of smaller issues and problems and let licensed people deal with the serious mental health issues. Everyone is b\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*ing about safety measures and testing (despite college students being one of the least likely groups to have serious implications from the disease) while serious mental health problems have quadrupled in the United States.
